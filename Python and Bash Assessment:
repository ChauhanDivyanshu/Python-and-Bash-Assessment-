Python and Bash Assessment:
1. Grade Checker
Take a score as input and print the grade based on the following:
90+ : "A"
80-89 : "B"
70-79 : "C"
60-69 : "D"
Below 60 : "F"
here we used a basic if else statement to carry out marks and all.
Answer :    
INPUT:

score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))
# Check grade using if-else
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"
# Display the result
print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")

OUTPUT: 

Enter your score (0-100): 85
Your grade is: B

 
2 Student Grades 
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades. Allow the user to:
Add a new student and grade.
Update an existing studentâ€™s grade.
Print all student grades.
Used dictionary and basic operations. Using if else:
Answer:

INPUT:
# Student Grades Program
# Initialize an empty dictionary
student_grades = {}
while True:
    print("\nChoose an option:")
    print("1. Add a new student and grade")
    print("2. Update an existing student's grade")
    print("3. Print all student grades")
    print("4. Exit")
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")
    if choice == "1":
        name = input("Enter student name: ")
        if name in student_grades:
            print(f"{name} already exists. Use option 2 to update the grade.")
        else:
            grade = input("Enter grade: ")
            student_grades[name] = grade
            print(f"{name} added with grade {grade}.")
    elif choice == "2":
        name = input("Enter student name to update: ")
        if name in student_grades:
            grade = input("Enter new grade: ")
            student_grades[name] = grade
            print(f"{name}'s grade updated to {grade}.")
        else:
            print(f"{name} does not exist. Use option 1 to add the student.")
    elif choice == "3":
        if not student_grades:
            print("No students in the list.")
        else:
            print("\nStudent Grades:")
            for name, grade in student_grades.items():
                print(f"{name}: {grade}")
    elif choice == "4":
        print("Exiting the program.")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 4.") 



OUTPUT:

Choose an option:
1. Add a new student and grade
2. Update an existing student's grade
3. Print all student grades
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1-4): 1
Enter student name: Divyanshu
Enter grade: A
Divyanshu added with grade A.

 

3.Write to a File
Write a program to create a text file and write some content to it.
Using file functions like write and open.
Answer:

INPUT:

# Create or open a file in write mode
file = open("myfile.txt", "w")
# Write content to the file
file.write("Hello, this is a sample text written to the file.\n")
file.write("This is the second line of the file.")
# Close the file
file.close()
print("Content written successfully to 'myfile.txt'.")

OUTPUT:

Hello, this is a sample text written to the file.
This is the second line of the file.
 

4. Read from a File
We used open in read mode and file.read to read and print to display.
Answer:
# Open the file in read mode
file = open("myfile.txt", "r")
# Read the content of the file
content = file.read()
# Print the content
print("File Content:\n")
print(content)
# Close the file
file.close()
